Exercise for reference: 

d = {"Name": "John", "Surname": "Smith"}
print(d["Smith"])

Question : Here I'll get a key error after running above code so, you need to find why am I getting this error?
Also how can I access the surname "Smith"?

Hint: A KeyError always means there is no such given key in the dictionary
