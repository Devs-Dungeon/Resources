Question : 

Create a dictionary of keys a, b, c where each key has as value a list from 1 to 10, 11 to 20, and 21 to 30 respectively. 
Then print out the dictionary in a nice format.

d = {'a' : [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],
       'b' : [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20],
       'c' : [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30]}

Hint: Use a range function to create the lists
