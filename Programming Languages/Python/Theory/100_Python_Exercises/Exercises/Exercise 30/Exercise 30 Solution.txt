Question:  Why do you get an error and how would you fix it?

def foo(a=2, b):
    return a + b


Answer : We get an error message like : "Syntax Error : non - default argument follows default arguments

Example 1 : 

def foo(a=2, b):
    return a + b

Now if I call this function like:

foo(5) --> then python will get confuse and it will understand that for which variable I'm passing values
               whether it is a or b.

Example 2 : 

def foo(b, a=2):
    return a + b

Now if I call this function like:

foo(5) --> then it will return value that is 7 because now we're passing value for variable b not a and python
               will take 5 as value of b and 2 as default value of a.

Example 3 : 

def foo(b, a=2):
    return a + b

Now if I call this function like:

foo(5, 4) --> Then it will return value that is 9 because first it will 5 as a value of b and 4 as a value
                  of a and then it will return the sum value.
