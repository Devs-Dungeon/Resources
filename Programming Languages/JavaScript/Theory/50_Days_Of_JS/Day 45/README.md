# Find The Parity Outlier

## Instructions
- You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. 
- The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. 
- Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

## Examples
- [2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36] Should return: 11 (the only odd number)

- [160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21] Should return: 160 (the only even number)

## Challenges (0/3 done)
- [ ] findOutlier([2,6,8,10,3]) should return 3
- [ ] findOutlier([0,0,3,0,0]) should return 3
- [ ] findOutlier([1,1,0,1,1]) should return 0

```js
function findOutlier(integers) {
  //your code here
}
```
